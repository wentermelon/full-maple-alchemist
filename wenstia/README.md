Personal farming macros for KastiaMS by me.

# Changelog

## 1.2.1 - [ 12.06.2020 ]
### Changed
- buffs() disabled from macros. Obtained a buff crystal which allows for 1-hour-long duration for buffs so no need to cast it so frequently.
- Changed attack key from Z to X. Spirit Claw key binding moved from Z to X.

For more information, please check the [changelog](/changelog.md).

# Features
As a set of macros, it seeks to automate various tasks. Features and functionality include:

- Auto-swim: Allows player to traverse a long flat platform while attacking, also known as "swimming" in Kastia terminology.
- Auto-attack: Select from various attack patterns to suit different maps and platforms.
- Auto-dojo: Puts the player through KastiaMS' Chaos dojo to farm dojo points fast.
- Auto-gathering: Gathers the mining/herb nodes on the left and right side of the player.

Will continue to add more functionality and stable macros.
